# Advent of Code

My [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) solutions.

They expect a very specific external directory structure for input files since the files were removed 
from this repository. YMMV on anything from 2023 and earlier.

For 2024 onward, the assumption is that this repository is cloned to `~/dev/adventofcode` or 
`C:\dev\adventofcode`, whether UNIX or Windows. Alongside it is a `~/dev/aoc-inputs`/`C:\dev\aoc-inputs` 
which has the following structure:

`adventYEAR` -> `test` and `real` -> `DayXX.txt`

For example, `advent2024/test/Day03.txt` and `advent2024/real/Day01.txt`.
